      </div>
      <div>
        <p>I am a happy person and I spent several years working as an entrepreneur
          in organizing international events, but a couple of years
          ago serendipitous events inspired me to get into IT, and I love it!</p>

        <p>I am self-educated in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python then I started
          with Restart Network's ONE program for one year. There I got plenty of
          information about LAMP STACK (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) then I specialized
          in MERN STACK (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS/Redux, and Nodejs). So far Django
          the framework of Python has been the most fascinating to me, thus I am building
          recently my applications with Django as Back-end and React/Redux as Front-end. </p>

        <p> One of the most valuable things that I have learned during my studies is the concept of self-learning.
          I know how to learn new technologies fast and stay up to date. There is nothing greater than finding
          opportunities for hard-working people to do awesome things, and it is a fantastic process that
          I feel lucky to participate in.</p>

        <p> Besides my job, I am volunteering in providing programming courses for refugees
          or low-income people who are willing to build/change careers. </p>

        <p>I love meeting new people and learning new things, send me an email if you want to know more about me. </p>
