            <h1>About Me </h1>
            <p>My name is Yonas Kessete Kifle. I came from Eritrea. I studied and graduated with Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering In my country of origin.
              After that, I got an opportunity to work with my profession (as an Engineer) in Eritrea, Southsudan and Angola.
            </p>
            <p> Then, I came to the Netherland in 2018. Since then, I studied Dutch B2 level, and I furthered my studies with Master in Environmental Science with specialization in
              water Science and management. <p>In order to improve my digital status, I am taking Full Stack Developer by Matrix Master Rotterdam.</p> After graduation, I will be open for Full Stack Developer,
              in addition to water manager, water advisor, and civil engineer</p> <p>

            </p>
            <p>
              In terms of experience, I have amassed over eight years of significant, progressive experiences in civil engineering projects, from supervision to designing and consulting of private companies and governmental organizations in Eritrea, South Sudan, and Angola. Moreover, I have worked as an auditor and manager in the sales and stock departments. And all of them were successful. My progressive experience in my fields has allowed me to develop a strong relationship with clients in building skills and leading multi-disciplinary teams.

              Moreover, during my master's course at Utrecht University, I got a chance to dive into the practical world through a Transdisciplinary case study course. In this course, a project, "Decreasing Water Demand via Water Conservation and Water Demand Management Measures in Nairobi, Kenya," was given to us (a group of students from different disciplines) to advise our client World Waternet Amsterdam, and It was successfully completed. Moreover, I also got a chance to do my thesis by PBL (Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency), as they were looking for someone to do modeling the "Potential of Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) for reducing current water stresses and future challenges over Sub-Saharan Africa." In this case, we used the PCR-GLOBWB model for modeling reclaimed wastewater as a source of recharge and, it was successfully finalized.

              Currently, I am taking a short training in IT (JavaScript, and python) in order to develop my digital level.
